## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Tasks
- Create and intiate e-commerce schema in SQL
- Create and initiate table models through sequelize
- Seed the database
- Create GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories, products, and tags
- Use Insomnia to make sure everything works as intended

## My Learnings
- I learned how to use sequelize to create tables and relationships in an SQL database
- Got more comfortable with routes and utilizing GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to manipulate the data in a database
- Got more comfortable with Insomnia

## Future Improvements
- Cleaning up the tags once something has been deleted
